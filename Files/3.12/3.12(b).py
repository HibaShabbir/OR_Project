# Question – 3.12:
#    (a)
#     X1 = Number of plates made per day
#     X2 = Number of mugs made per day
#     X3 = Number of steins made per day
#     X4 = Total daily production
#         MAX 2.50X1 + 3.25X2 + 3.90X3
#         S.T.
#         2X1 + 3X2 + 6X3 <= 1920 ((4)(8)(60) Molding min.)
#         8X1 + 12X2 + 14X3 <= 3840 ((8)(8)(60) Finishing min.)
#         X2 >= 150 (Minimum mugs)

# b) Combine the first two constraints into one:
